I adjusted the current number plates with a .1mm deep cut for the numbers, this easy mod tricks orca slicers into having a surface to use a different color so you get solid clean looking 2 tone numbers

>[!IMPORTANT]
> if you are not using an ERCF it is still easy to use m600 codes in your slicer for dual-color printing.
