# ERCF Pre Gate System
ERCF Pre Gate Mod

Welcome to the ERCF Pre Gate project. This project is to be used with the Filamentalist filament rewinder system.

>[!WARNING]
> The ERCF Pre Gate System is "good to go" as is, however, I want to finish a "neopixel" version for those who want that as an option.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The below hardware list is for an ERCF that utilizes 8 gates only, the individual pre-gate hardware list is below this one.

### 8 Gate Hardware List:

| Hardware | Description | Quantity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `m5x12mm` | BHCS | x8 |
| `m5 T-Nut` | m5 extrusion nut | x8|
| `m2x8` | SHCS| x1 |
| `m3x8mm` | SHCS| x8|
| `m3 heatsert` | standard voron | x8|
| `jst 2.54` | female | x8|
| `ECAS` | ECAS Fitting | x16|
| `m5.5 ball` | Ball bearing | x8|
| `omron endstop` | standard endstop switch | x8|

>[!IMPORTANT]
>You may choose to build this system however you want, there are 4x pre gate .stls
>1. ERCF_pre_gate_base_(x5) - this is your main pre-gate base
>2. ERCF_pre_gate_base_end_(x1) - this is the end of the line, your last one, it has no hexes and has a smooth face
>3. ERCF_pre_gate_base_left_MMU_mount_(x1) - this part is used if you want to mount the MMU underneath the pregate system for simple wiring and requires you to use a higher / taller mount system.
>4. ERCF_pre_gate_base_right_MMU_mount_(x1) - this part is used if you want to mount the MMU underneath the pregate system, again, taller mounts needed.

>I had the opportunity to work with Terrance (KinematicDigit) before cotton tail was released and I got the overall use and function from his idea, thank you Terrance for your hard work developing the cotton tail system. (even though this is designed for Filamentalist)
